My approach,
I made a function which takes the path as argument and plays the audio file named it Strike(path),
I used onClick event attribute to call the function when the button is clicked,
then added Keyboard event listener to call the function when the respective button is pressed on keyboard.
I added a pressed effect to the buttons when clicked by changing the box shadows, text shadow and opacity.

For the design, I went with a Kid's School theme,
I used bright and playful colors for buttons which go well and complement each other to make it look like a kid's toy.
I changed the background to charcoal and the heading to white with Chalkduster font, so the background looks like a BlackBoard in School.
The font I used for the buttons is KG HAPPY which is uneven on line like a kid's handwriting.
