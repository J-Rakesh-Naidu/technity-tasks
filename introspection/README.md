I am J Rakesh Naidu, II year AIE student.

For the next six months, I would like to focus on mastering my current skills and learning new stuff while exploring different fields of Computer Science.

I would be eager to contribute to the club by leveraging my skills.
As a passionate coder, I believe I could assist in ideas and projects.
I'm also passionate about different fields of computer science, and I'd love to contribute ideas and efforts to help the club grow and thrive.
Whether it's through organizing events, collaborating with other members, or taking on leadership responsibilities, I'm committed to making a meaningful and positive impact on the club's goals and initiatives.

I think the selection process is good and the people who made this really put some effort to make it perfect.
