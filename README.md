## Introduction
I am Rakesh Naidu, II year AIE student. I have learned C programming, HTML, CSS, JS, Java and Python. I think I am decent at all of them.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
For the next six months, I would like to focus on improving my current languages and learning new stuff while exploring different fields of Computer Science. My main plan is to become a Full-Stack Developer.

## How would you contribute back to the club?
I'd love to contribute ideas and efforts to help the club grow and thrive.
Whether it's through organizing events, collaborating with other members, or taking on leadership responsibilities, I'm committed to making a meaningful and positive impact on the club's goals and initiatives. And as a senior student, I can mentor freshers in their journey of CS.

## Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
I think the selection process is great and the people really put some good effort to make them. It is great to have a club of our own. Hoping for it to do amazing things ahead.
