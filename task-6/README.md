# Approach

I never worked with APIs or made Telegram Bots. This was a completely new to me.

I watched a few videos in youtube on how to create a bot and after a bit of testing I learned how APIs work.

If the movie exists, My bot gives the Poster and some details about the movie and saves it in a csv file.

else it will send a sorry message

Each chat session will overwrite the csv file and all the commands work.

/start - start the bot

/stop - stop the bot

/help - shows all commands

/movie moviename - gives info about movie and uploads data in csv

/export - sends a downloadable csv file
